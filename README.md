# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-With-Python
This repository contains the main linked data structures in computer science as well as some of their applications. It also includes different algorithms. 
It is all implemented using python.

## Featured data structures:
- Stacks (Node based)
- Queues (Node based)
- Linked Lists (Node based)

## Applications:
- Board Games Database (Just OOP no linked data structures)
- CPU Scheduler (OOP, Queues and Stacks)
- Web History (OOP, Linked Lists)
- Balanced (Stacks)

## Recursive Algorithms: 
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Recursive Power
- Pandemic Outbreak
- Palindrome
